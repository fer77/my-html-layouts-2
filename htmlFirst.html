  <p>At StarChefs' tenth annual International Chefs Congress in NYC, some of the most creative minds in the industry were asked what "Open Source Cooking" means to them. From the highly energetic molecular gastronomist José Andrés to the elusive Zen naturalist
    Michel Bras, the answers they gave were as diverse and as interesting as the great chefs themselves.</p>

    <p>"We are who we are because of all the people we have worked with before," proclaimed chef José Andrés. "And, we are only as good as we are today because
    of the people around us." To Andrés, open source cooking was a broad concept which included significant collaboration with his team, a group of people he leads, but who he looks up to and learns from nonetheless. "Convincing others to join us on this
    road is 'hiring people'."</p>
